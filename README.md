Barebones bot for message deletion which happens a certain amount of time after the message was sent. (Acts like snapchat)

Messages won't be deleted if the bot restarts, feel free to add that functionality yourself (you need to store the message ids in a database and then cache them once the bot has restarted)

I'm not here to fix anything, if it breaks figure it out yourself or you can dm me on discord LordOfTheCube#0419 but only if your question is remotely intelligent.
